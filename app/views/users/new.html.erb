You agree that we may automatically upgrade those Products, and these Terms will apply to such upgrades.</p>

			<p>b. Our license to you</p>

			<p>Subject to these Terms and our policies (including our Acceptable Usage Policy), we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use our Products.</p>

			<p>2. Your Content</p>

			<p>a. Posting content</p>

			<p>Golpo allows you to post content, including photos, comments, and other materials. Anything that you post or otherwise make available on our Products is referred to as "User Content." You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to Golpo.</p>

			<p>More simply put:</p>

			<p>If you post your content on Golpo, it still belongs to you but we can show it to people and others can share it.</p>

			<p>b. How Golpo and other users can use your content</p>

			<p>You grant Golpo and its users a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, store, display, reproduce, share, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute your User Content on Golpo solely for the purposes of operating, developing, providing, and using the Golpo Products. Nothing in these Terms shall restrict other legal rights Golpo may have to User Content, for example under other licenses. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.</p>

			<p>c. How long we keep your content</p>

			<p>Following termination or deactivation of your account, or if you remove any User Content from Golpo, we may retain your User Content for a commercially reasonable period of time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. Furthermore, Golpo and its users may retain and continue to use, store, display, reproduce, share, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute any of your User Content that other users have stored or shared through Golpo.</p>

			<p>More simply put:</p>

			<p>Copies of content shared with others may remain even after you delete the content from your account.</p>

			<p>e. Feedback you provide</p>

			<p>We value hearing from our users, and are always interested in learning about ways we can make Golpo more awesome. If you choose to submit comments, ideas or feedback, you agree that we are free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you. By accepting your submission, Golpo does not waive any rights to use similar or related Feedback previously known to Golpo, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you</p>

			<p>More simply put:</p>

			<p>Also, don't post porn or spam or be a jerk to other users. Oh, and we can actually use your suggestions to make Golpo better.</p>

			<p>3. Copyright Policy</p>

			<p>Golpo has adopted and implemented the Golpo Copyright Policy in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. For more information, please read our Copyright Policy.</p>

			<p>Our Products may contain links to third-party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by Golpo. We do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access any third party website, service, or content from Golpo, you do so at your own risk and you agree that Golpo will have no liability arising from your use of or access to any third-party website, service, or content.</p>

			<p>More simply put:</p>

			<p>6. Termination</p>

			<p>Golpo may terminate or suspend this license at any time, with or without cause or notice to you. Upon termination, you continue to be bound by Sections 2 and 6-12 of these Terms.</p>

			<p>We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.</p>

			<p>7. Indemnity</p>

			<p>If you use our Products for commercial purposes in violation of Section 1(c), as determined in our sole and absolute discretion, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Golpo and its officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, suits, proceedings, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees (including costs of defense of claims, suits or proceedings brought by third parties), in any way related to (a) your access to or use of our Products, (b) your User Content, or (c) your breach of any of these Terms.</p>

			<p>More simply put:</p>

			<p>If we are sued because of something your business does on Golpo, you have to pay our costs. Also, you should have created a business account and agreed to our commercial terms in the first place.</p>

			<p>8. Disclaimers</p>

			<p>The Products and all included content are provided on an "as is" basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.</p>

			<p>Golpo SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.</p>

			<p>Golpo takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other user or third party posts or transmits using our Products. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose.</p>

			<p>More simply put:</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, people post bad stuff on user-generated content sites like Golpo. We take that kind of thing seriously but you still might run into it before we have a chance to take it down. If you see bad stuff, please report it to us.</p>

			<p>9. Limitation of Liability</p>

			<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, Golpo SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE PRODUCTS; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL Golpo'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00).</p>

			<p>More simply put:</p>

			<p>We are building the best service we can for you but we can't promise it will be perfect. We're not liable for various things. If you think we are, let's try to work it out like adults.</p>

			<p>10. Arbitration</p>

			<p>For any dispute you have with Golpo, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If Golpo has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and Golpo agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Golpo will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Golpo ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

			<p>11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</p>

			<p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Santa Clara County, California or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, for any actions not subject to Section 10 (Arbitration).</p>

			<p>Our Products are controlled and operated from the United States, and we make no representations that they are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p>

			<p>More simply put:</p>

			<p>The Bay Area is beautiful this time of year. It doesn't matter what time of year it is, that's what's so great! Anyway, you'll have to sue us here.</p>

			<p>12. General Terms</p>

			<p>Notification Procedures and changes to these Terms. Golpo reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if we so choose. We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you. By continuing to access or use the Products after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Products.</p>

			<p>More simply put:</p>

			<p>If we're making a big change to the terms, we'll let you know.</p>

			<p>Assignment. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Golpo without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>

			<p>Entire Agreement/Severability. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Golpo in connection with the Products, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Golpo concerning the Products. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
			<p>No Waiver. No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Golpo's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

			<p>More simply put:</p>

			<p>These three passages are part of just about every online terms agreement. Basically, they ensure that a deal is a deal when you're using a site, including Golpo.</p>

			<p>India and U.S Government Agencies: If you are a India and United States federal government agency, your use of Golpo is subject to our Business Terms of Service and this amendment.</p>

			<p>More simply put:</p>

			<p>If you're from the government, we'd love to help.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Thank you for using Golpo! We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have regarding your information. Because we're an Internet company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we've tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. We welcome your questions and comments on this policy.</p>

			<p>What information do we collect?</p>

			<p>We collect information in two ways:</p>

			<p>1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.</p>

			<p>When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, profile photo, comments, likes, email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. If you're using Golpo on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with location data.</p>

			<p>You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to Golpo, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.</p>

			<p>2. We get technical information when you use our products.</p>

			<p>These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, there's certain information that almost always gets created and recorded in an automated way. The same is true when you use our products, and here are some of the types of information we collect in this way.</p>

			<p>Log Data. When you use Golpo, our servers automatically record information about your interaction with our products ("log data"), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you use it to access Golpo. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to Golpo, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used Golpo.</p>

			<p>Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Golpo account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Golpo settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit Golpo.</p>

			<p>Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using Golpo on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p>

			<p>How do we use the information we collect?</p>

			<p>We use the information we collect to provide our products to you and make them better, develop new products, and protect Golpo and our users. For example, we may log how often people use two different versions of a product, which can help us understand which version is better.</p>

			<p>We also use the information we collect to offer you customized content -- including helping you discover content you might like or provide you with tailored advertising. For example, if you've indicated that you're interested in cooking, we may suggest food-related content, or people.</p>

			<p>We also use the information we collect to:</p>

			<p>send you updates (such as when certain activity, like repins or comments, happens on Golpo), newsletters, marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you. For example, depending on your email notification settings, we may send you weekly updates that include pins you may like. You can decide to stop getting these updates by updating your account settings (or through other settings we may provide).</p>
			<p>Respond to your questions or comments.</p>
			<p>The information we collect may be "personally identifiable" (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or "non-personally identifiable" (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or store information wherever Golpo does business, including countries outside your own.</p>

			<p>What choices do you have about your information?</p>

			<p>Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices over your information. If you have a Golpo account, many of the choices you have on Golpo are built directly in to the product or your account settings. For example, you can:</p>

			<p>Access and change information in your profile page at any time, and choose whether your profile page is available to search engines;</p>
			<p>Link or unlink your Golpo account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also choose whether or not to publish your activity on Golpo to that service.</p>

			<p>Close your account at any time. When you close your account, we'll deactivate it and remove your content from Golpo. We may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and spam).</p>
			<p>In addition to the examples above, we offer other choices that you can learn more about in our Help Center.</p>

			<p>You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Golpo. For example:</p>

			<p>The browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage;
			Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or other data is shared with us</p>.
			<p>To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by the device or software provider.</p>

			<p>How do we share the information we collect?</p>

			<p>Golpo is a tool people use to create and find amazing content. When you create public content, anyone can view them. You may also provide us with profile page information that that anyone can view. The other limited instances where we may share your personal information include:</p>

			<p>When we have your consent. This includes sharing information with other services (like Facebook or Twitter) when you’ve chosen to link to your Golpo account to those services or publish your activity on Golpo to them. For example, you can choose to publish your content to Facebook or Twitter.</p>
			<p>We may employ third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share data with a security consultant to help us get better at identifying spam or with our accountants to make sure we’re keeping the books right. In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf. For more information about the providers we use, please see our Help Center.</p>
			<p>If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Golpo; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</p>
			<p>We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy.</p>
			<p>We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our partners or others. For example, we may tell a business using Golpo how many people shared something they created, or the percentage of people who view a content.</p>

			<p>Our Policy on Children’s Information</p>

			<p>Golpo is not directed to children under 13. If you learn that your minor child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us.</p>

			<p>How do we make changes to this policy?</p>

			<p>We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we’ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Golpo after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or obtain your consent as required by law.</p>
